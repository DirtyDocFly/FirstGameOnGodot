# Learning Godot: 2D Mini-Game Project

Welcome to my personal learning repository for mastering Godot Engine and creating a 2D mini-game!

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through learning Godot Engine by following the introductory guide available in the official Godot documentation. The ultimate goal is to apply this knowledge to develop a small 2D game from scratch.

## Project Structure

- **Documentation**: This repository includes notes, summaries, and code snippets derived from the official Godot documentation.
- **Mini-Game Development**: As part of my learning process, I'll be implementing a 2D mini-game using Godot Engine. The progress and updates will be shared in the corresponding folders.

## Progress

- **Introduction**: I'm currently following the introductory tutorials provided by Godot to grasp the fundamentals.
- **Game Development**: Parallelly, I'm working on the mini-game project, integrating concepts learned from the tutorials.

## Repository Contents

- **Code**: Includes scripts, scenes, and assets used in both the learning exercises and the mini-game project.
- **Resources**: Links to useful articles, videos, and references that have helped me in this learning journey.
